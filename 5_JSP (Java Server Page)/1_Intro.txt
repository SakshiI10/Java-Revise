1. Tomcat only runs servlets, not JSP directly.
a. Servlets are the core Java classes that handle HTTP requests.
b. JSP files are converted into servlets by the server before execution.

2. Servlets display data, not a page.
a. A servlet can send plain text or HTML in response using PrintWriter.
b. Since servlets don’t separate logic and presentation that's why JSP was introduced.

3. JSP makes programming easier:
a. No need to explicitly extend HttpServlet.
b. No need to manually create PrintWriter, request, or response objects.
c. Simplifies embedding Java code directly within HTML.

4. JSP Scriptlets and Directives:
Scriptlet: <% code %> → Java code inside the service method of the generated servlet.
Declaration: <%! code %> → Declare methods or variables outside the service method.
Page Directive: <%@ page import="java.util.*" %> → Import packages.
Expression: <%= var_name %> → Output the value of a variable directly.
Comment: <%-- comment text --%> → JSP comment.
