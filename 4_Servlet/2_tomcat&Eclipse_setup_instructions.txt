1. For new server in Eclipse select: No servers are available... in servers option below.

2. Select Apache: 
Tomcat v11.0 Server.
Then new dialogue bx will be opened. Browse to the folder where apache tomcat-11.0.1 is present (select same folder inside the extracted one) otherwise it will show error.

3. When both are compatible you'll get: "Specify the Tomcat installation directory and JRE for this runtime. The specified JRE controls the highest supported Java Facet version." on top. 
Then select the same folder in Download and install and wait for the installation (right below).

4. Once done click on finish. Run the server. Visit the localhost.
