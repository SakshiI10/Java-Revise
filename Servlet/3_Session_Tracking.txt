There are 4 techniques used in Session (Time interval) Tracking:
1. URL Rewriting
2. Hidden Form Field
3. Cookies
4. HttpSession


Cookies
1. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it cannot remember users across multiple requests. To maintain state, session tracking mechanisms are used.

2. Cookies are small pieces of user information stored on the client side (browser). They help in identifying the user during subsequent visits or requests.

3. A cookie is a small amount of information created by a server (e.g., a servlet) and sent to the web browser. The browser stores it and automatically sends it back to the server with future requests, enabling the server to recognize the user.

4. Use:
a. First login:
i. You enter your username and password.
ii. The server verifies them.
iii. If correct, the server creates a session ID (or token) and sends it to your browser inside a cookie.
iv. Your browser saves this cookie.

b. Next time you visit (or reload a page):
i. The browser automatically sends the cookie back with the request.
ii. The server reads the session ID from the cookie.
iii. If the session ID is valid, the server recognizes you without asking for username and password again.
iv. The server uses the session ID to recognize you and fetch your details from its database.

5. Types of Cookies:
i. Non-persistent (Session) Cookie – Stored only in the browser’s memory until the browser is closed. Deleted once the session ends.
ii. Persistent Cookie – Stored on the client’s hard drive with an expiration date. Remains available even after the browser is closed until it expires or is manually deleted.
